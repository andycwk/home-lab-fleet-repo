To bootstrap the cluster 

The entire bootstrap for the cluster is self contained and will execute all dependancies and requirements to spin up the cluster with a one click style action.

Simply run `./bootstrap/bootstrap.sh` from the same folder as this note.

I've designed the structure of the fleet repo so Flux will install updates to the initial secrets once the bootstrap has been completed.
